Android for ARMv6 [ RaspberryPi Edition ] - CyanogenMod 11.0
===========


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android for ARMv6/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html).


To initialize your local repository for creating Cyanogenmod 11.0 for the RaspberryPi
You need to download and run the vendor initialize script.

    curl -L http://goo.gl/WQPdtQ > vendorinit.sh
    sudo chmod 755 vendorinit.sh
    source vendorinit.sh
    [See Notes for more info]


2. Downloads the RaspberryPi specific local manifest.
  

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Build your device:

    source build/envsetup.sh
    lunch rpi-eng
    make -j4 


Notes
-----
The vendorinit.sh Script carries out 2 tasks
1. runs the standard repo init to get the cm-11.0 androidarmv6 manifest 
2. Downloads manifests/broadcom-rpi-vendor.xml to .repo/local_manifests

repo init -u git://github.com/androidarmv6/android.git -b cm-11.0


Disclaimer
--------

It's a tough world out there and basically you're on your own.
"So, don't get nervous and start asking for help, That's exactly 
what they want you to do Make it on your own,"
